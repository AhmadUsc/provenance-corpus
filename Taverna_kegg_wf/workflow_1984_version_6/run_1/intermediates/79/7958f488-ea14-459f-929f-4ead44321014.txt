The drug repurposing workflow system screens at least 20 bacterial proteomes against this set of proteins that are already being treated against using established drugs. By screening the bacterial proteomes it will be possible to find proteins of highly similar structure to those that are existing drug protein targets and so this will infer that it is highly likely that the drugs can be used as antimicrobials against these proteins of highly similar structure.   Proteomes that will be screened belong to Gram positive bacteria, with special focus on <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>. We look at a variety of species and strains as the company advised. A mixture of screening targets could potentially identify targets for broad-spectrum antimicrobial development. The drug repurposing workflow shows where in the KEGG pathways the proteins are active and therefore where the action of the drug will be in the biochemical pathways of the bacteria. The workflow will update the Ondex database where new information on Gene Ontology annotations, functional annotation and literature references are available. All information about each unique protein is made available in an HTML document.
